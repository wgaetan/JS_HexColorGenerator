# JS_HexColorGenerator
A first basic project to start learning javascript (following this tutorial: "https://enlight.nyc/projects/hex-color-generator").

/!\ The tutorial seemed a little outdated, so i made the following change:
  * In app.js line 21 using evenListener rather than the syntax showed in the tutorial
  * In app.js "keydown" eventListener, "KeyboardEvent.keyCode" is deprecated, i used "KeyboardEvent.key" instead.
  
In addition of the tutorial content, i used this project to introduce myself to:
  * Linting tool (EsLint)(Google's styleguide).
  * JSDoc commenting.
